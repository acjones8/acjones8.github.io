# Software Development as a field
Over the last 4 months, I’ve learned *a lot* about professional
software development and what working as a programmer is actually
like. Before taking this class, I’d mostly done small independent
tasks with programming – solving a particular puzzle for a game, or
perhaps editing shell scripts to fix a program’s compiling process.
However, I’d never done much work with others before or needed to
program in any style but my own, and those are the most important
skills I got out of this class.
# Working with others
Working with other students on a final project together introduced me
to a lot of useful skills – in particular, learning how to design and
manage a project on schedule, how to separate responsibilities and
coordinate to avoid duplicating work, and how to resolve issues
together. Using a methodology called agile development, we assigned
separate tasks on GitHub for each member to work on, and we met
multiple times to share our progress, assist each other with hurdles,
and set goals to work for the next period until meeting again. I’ve
had a life long interest in open source software, but I’ve yet to
contribute to a project in a significant way beyond small patches here
and there – with the skills I learned in this class, I feel ready to
tackle working on a larger project.
# Consistent coding standards
Working on my own projects, I’ve always used my own code style, which
is typically quite verbose – I like to use a lot of spaces, put my
braces on their own lines, and I dislike using obscure tricks or
quirks of a language to write more expressive statements if a short
series of simpler ones achieves the same effect. However, I’ve learned
that standard coding styles vary quite significantly, and features
that I would consider unusual are actually quite standard in other
languages – for example, we alternated between ‘ and “ in Javascript
according to style guidelines. This was pretty new to me – in C, the
difference is that one denotes a character and the other an actual
string with a null terminator, so you can’t switch them according to
style guidelines, because you’re actually changing what the code does.
Likewise, in shell scripting, one will trigger expansion and the other
won’t, so they will actually change the behavior of the code in some
situations. Consistent coding standards are extremely helpful for
bridging these differences, and the tooling that we used (eslint in
particular) helped to enforce those standards. I don’t think I would
have remembered all of the requirements if I had to do it purely from
memory!
# Conclusion
These two topics in particular, the value of a consistent coding style
and of how to collaborate with others on a project, are skills that I
know I’ll use extensively in my future. In that sense, I think ICS 314
was probably the single most important class I’ve taken so far in my
college career.
